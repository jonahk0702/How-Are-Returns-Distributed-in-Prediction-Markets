# Polymarket trades Analyze

> Analyze trading behavior like never before!

## Brief overview
The goals was to be able to analyze returns and traits of people on the platform Polymarket. It turned out to be way more complex than expected.

Getting the data requires sql calls to Bigquery to access the Public Dataset. Creating the query took research.

Then the dataset was built with thousands of queries like this one... But that was the encrypted dataset...

In order to decrypt it took in depth knowledge in the workings of Polymarket.

Then we had a raw dataset. We needed to follow the research we'd read and create predictors! These are metrics which summarise a person behaviour
i.e. their general risk tolerance.

Only once that was done, we could do some modeling, which we did as much as could be done!

```

Note, you will not have access to the data, as a result of it being too big to fit on Github. But if you want it, we can share it easily.
However, it is big (around 3Gb)




## Available Metrics 

The system calculates over 40 different metrics to analyze trader behavior:

```
   +---------------------------------------+
   |                                       |
   |         Trading Metrics               |
   |                                       |
   +---------------------------------------+
          |              |              |
          v              v              v
 +----------------+ +-----------+ +-------------+
 |                | |           | |             |
 | RETURNS &      | | RISK &    | | BEHAVIORAL  |
 | PROFITABILITY  | | VOLATILITY| | PATTERNS    |
 |                | |           | |             |
 +----------------+ +-----------+ +-------------+
 | • Win Rate     | | • Sharpe  | | • Momentum  |
 | • Profit Factor| | • Max     | | • Mean      |
 | • Return Ratio | |   Drawdown| |   Reversion |
 | • Cash Multiple| | • Volatil | | • Risk      |
 | • Kelly Crit.  | |   -ity    | |   Tolerance |
 +----------------+ +-----------+ +-------------+
 And many many more!
```

### Key Metric Categories:

1. **Return & Profitability**: How much you win
2. **Risk & Volatility**: How much you might lose
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: How you make decisions
4. **Time & Holding**: When you trade
5. **Market-Specific**: What you know that others don't


### Usage

1. The main.py goes through all the steps in creating the dataset.
2. It links to all scripts that run desired Compounded
3. Functions are commented out, but to recreate the dataset, uncomment them.
4. Note this can all be run for free! But API usage does have an account. I deactivatded my service account before going public, so you'll have to add your own.
5. That will output a csv.
6. Use the Full Analysis Notebook to do the analysis!
